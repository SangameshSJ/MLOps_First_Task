I created a Python module for a simple chatbot, built a wheel package for it, installed the package, and tested it. The wheel package was configured to automatically install its dependencies upon installation.
A Wheel is a built package format for Python that simplifies the distribution and installation of Python package, wheels are precompiled, which speeds up installation by eliminating the need to build the package from source on each machine.
Wheel files have a .whl extension and contain all the necessary files for a package, including code, metadata, and any dependencies specified in requirements.txt or install_requires in setup.py. When a wheel is installed, pip reads its metadata to identify and install any dependencies automatically, ensuring all components required for the package are present and functional.
